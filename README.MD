I was facing problems with Javascript. I posted error on Stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28784862/error-with-js-erb-file . I received great help from [Anton Fefilov](https://github.com/antonfefilov) that spent an entire week (I really don't know what part of day was in Anton country) helping me, thanks Anton, this tutorial cannot be completed without your help.

- I faced other problem, with render and ajax. But problem was solved. It can be seen here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28794432/ajax-with-rails-appending-div-not-working/28796246#28796246
